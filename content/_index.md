# Welcome
This is my personal blog — a collection of notes, guides, and project logs focused on:

- Linux systems (mostly Arch)
- Electric scooter modding
- Embedded devices
- Fictional aircraft design
- Self-hosting and DIY networking

I write to document what I’ve learned and to help others skip the trial-and-error phase.

Expect concise, practical content — no fluff, no filler. Just real-world fixes, experiments, and side projects.
