Hey, I'm Utku — a student and hobbyist with a strong interest in Linux, engineering, and experimental projects. I like digging into how things work, often modifying or building systems to suit my needs (and sometimes just for fun).

Here’s what I usually spend time on:

- **Linux (especially Arch)** — from setup to customization, I enjoy solving low-level issues and shaping the system to be minimal and efficient.
- **Electric scooters** — modding Xiaomi scooters like the M365/1S/Essential, tweaking firmware, battery setups, and exploring advanced things like field weakening.
- **Embedded hardware** — I use Raspberry Pi and similar boards for custom servers, automation, and weird side projects.
- **Fictional aircraft and avionics** — I design aircraft concepts for fun, often combining realistic systems with creative freedom.
- **Networking and self-hosting** — from NAS systems and VPN networks, I like building things that serve a purpose.

I prefer projects that are useful or unconventional — I’m not interested in recreating tutorials for the 100th time. I also care about writing clean, focused guides so others can benefit from what I’ve figured out the hard way.

This blog is a place for me to share my projects, experiments, fixes, and thoughts. If you're into DIY, hacking things together, or engineering with a touch of chaos, you'll probably feel at home here.
